ALF: An Audio processing Library for Flash Game Development

Thank you for checking out the Audio Processing Library for Flash (ALF) developed by the Music and Entertainment Technology Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Drexel University. This library is intended to streamline audio playback, modification, and feature extraction for Flash applications using Actionscript 3. Using ALF, it is simple to play .wav and .mp3 audio files while synchronizing visual events with the audio to create applications that are highly music centric/reactive.

Developers who do not require significant control over the manner in which playback occurs are directed to use <ALF>. Those who want lower level control over the dynamic audio playback functionality of Actionscript3 should read the documentation on <DATF>.

To use either library a .swc (ShockWave Component) file is required. This file contains all the functions necessary to use either library. The .swc file will be available soon through Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/alf). For more info go to http://music.ece.drexel.edu/research/ALF.

To use the Shockwave Component (SWC) file in the "ALFTester.as" code (or your own code), open "ALFTester.fla" using Adobe CS4 (or quivalent). Go to File -> Publish Settings and click on the Flash tab. Click on the Settings button next to the Script drop down menu. Next click on the Library path tab and remove any existing paths for SWC files that may be listed. Click the small red folder icon and locate the ALFPackage.swc file you downloaded and then click Open. Select OK and save the file.

After this step is completed all you need to do is make sure the ALF.as and DATF.as files ( also at http://music.ece.drexel.edu/research/ALF) are included in your Flash package directory. You simply import them as you would any other Actionscript class file.
